Prior to information being sent to a language model such as GPT-4, data anonymization is essential for maintaining confidentiality and protecting privacy. Sensitive information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, and other identifiers connected to particular people, may be discovered and used improperly if it is not anonymised. Therefore, data can be used freely without jeopardising individuals' privacy rights or breaking data protection rules and regulations by hiding or erasing this personally identifying information (PII).

There are two steps involved in anonymization:
Identification: All data fields containing personally identifiable information (PII) should be identified.
Replacement: Replace all personally identifiable information (PII) with codes or pseudovalues that can be used as references but do not disclose any personal information about the individual. 

Frameworks used:
Langchain- To construct a LLM 
Faker - To create fake details
Presidio(Microsoft)- To anonymize and deanonymize data

This is User application project done using langchain, to overcome, data privacy issues, and understand how to store data in vectors.
